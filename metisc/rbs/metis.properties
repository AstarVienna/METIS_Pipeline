# TEMPLATE CONFIGURATION FILE

# Reduction Block Scheduler version: 1.0beta4
# 
# This file was generated with all properties commented out.
# 
# The Reduction Block Scheduler (RBS) requires an instrument-specific
# configuration for each instrument whose reduction blocks (RBs) will be
# submitted for processing.

# MANDATORY PROPERTIES

# The main job for each of this instrument's RBs. One or more instances of
# this job will be executed after an RB's opening job has completed. The RB's
# closing job will not be executed until all of its main jobs are complete.
# The value of this option is the command line to execute; variables $RB_NAME,
# $RECIPE_NAME, $RECIPE_PARAMETERS, $INSTRUMENT_NAME, $SOF_PATH,
# $PRODUCT_DIRECTORY, $PRODUCT_NAME_PREFIX, $RBS_RB_WORKING_DIRECTORY,
# $RBS_JOB_WORKING_DIRECTORY and $RBS_JOB_INSTANCE will be substituted, others
# will be rejected.

# ADDITIONAL PROPERTIES

# True if the RBS is permitted to run multiple main jobs in parallel whilst
# processing a given RB for this instrument, false otherwise. This option only
# has an effect if the RBS' primary configuration allows it.
# 
# Default value [false].
# 
rbs.instrument.allow.parallel.main.jobs=false

# True if the RBS is permitted to process multiple RBs in parallel for this
# instrument, false otherwise. This option only has an effect if the RBS'
# primary configuration allows it.
# 
# Default value [false].
# 
rbs.instrument.allow.parallel.rbs=true

# The closing job for each of this instrument's RBs, if enabled. One instance
# of this job will be executed after all of an RB's main jobs have completed.
# The RB's cleanup job will not be executed until its closing job is complete.
# The value of this option is the command line to execute; variables $RB_NAME,
# $RECIPE_NAME, $RECIPE_PARAMETERS, $INSTRUMENT_NAME, $SOF_PATH,
# $PRODUCT_DIRECTORY, $PRODUCT_NAME_PREFIX, $RBS_RB_WORKING_DIRECTORY and
# $RBS_JOB_WORKING_DIRECTORY will be substituted, others will be rejected.
# 
# Default value [].
# 
rbs.instrument.closing.job.command=/home/quality/RBS/bin/metis_closing.sh $RBS_RB_WORKING_DIRECTORY 

# The timeout after which a closing job will be forcibly terminated. Specified
# in seconds. Set this to zero if timeouts should be disabled.
# 
# Default value [60].
# 
rbs.instrument.closing.job.timeout=1200

# True if the RBS should delete temporary files after an RB has failed, false
# otherwise. If this option is enabled, the RBS will recursively delete the
# RB's temporary working directory and its contents.
# 
# Default value [false].
# 
# rbs.instrument.delete.temporary.files.on.rb.failure=true|false

# True if the RBS should delete temporary files after an RB has been
# successfully processed, false otherwise. If this option is enabled, the RBS
# will recursively delete the RB's temporary working directory and its
# contents.
# 
# Default value [false].
# 
rbs.instrument.delete.temporary.files.on.rb.success=true

# The timeout after which a main job will be forcibly terminated. Specified in
# seconds. Set this to zero if timeouts should be disabled.
# 
# Default value [600].
# 
rbs.instrument.main.job.timeout=7200

# Sets the number of main job instances to execute for each of this
# instrument's RBs. This value must be at least 1. This is usually set
# to the number of FITS extensions.
# 
# Default value [1].
# 
rbs.instrument.main.jobs.per.rb=1

# Sets the maximum number of jobs the RBS is permitted to run in parallel for
# this instrument. All opening, main and closing jobs are included in this
# figure. If the RBS' primary configuration does not allow this many jobs in
# parallel, the number of jobs will be capped at the value given in the
# primary configuration. Setting this option to zero tells the RBS to run all
# jobs as soon as possible, subject to the primary configuration.
# 
# Default value [1].
# 
rbs.instrument.maximum.parallel.jobs=2

# The opening job for each of this instrument's RBs, if enabled. One instance
# of this job will be executed immediately after an RB's setup job has
# completed. No main jobs will be executed for an RB until its opening job is
# complete. The value of this option is the command line to execute; variables
# $RB_NAME, $RECIPE_NAME, $RECIPE_PARAMETERS, $INSTRUMENT_NAME, $SOF_PATH,
# $PRODUCT_DIRECTORY, $PRODUCT_NAME_PREFIX, $RBS_RB_WORKING_DIRECTORY and
# $RBS_JOB_WORKING_DIRECTORY will be substituted, others will be rejected.
# 
# Default value [].
# 
# rbs.instrument.opening.job.command=STRING

# The timeout after which an opening job will be forcibly terminated.
# Specified in seconds. Set this to zero if timeouts should be disabled.
# 
# Default value [60].
# 
# rbs.instrument.opening.job.timeout=INTEGER

# True if this instrument requires a clean temporary working directory for
# each RB, false otherwise. If this option is set, temporary data left by a
# previous invocation of a given RB must be cleaned up before reprocessing
# that RB.
# 
# Default value [true].
# 
# rbs.instrument.require.clean.rb.working.directory=true|false

# True if RBs for this instrument should run a closing job, false otherwise.
# 
# Default value [false].
# 
rbs.instrument.run.closing.job=true

# True if RBs for this instrument should run a opening job, false otherwise.
# 
# Default value [false].
# 
# rbs.instrument.run.opening.job=true|false

# True if the closing job should be run in its own subdirectory below the RB's
# product directory, false otherwise.
# 
# Default value [false].
# 
rbs.instrument.use.closing.job.subdirectory=true

# True if main job instances should be run in their own subdirectories below
# the RB's product directory, false otherwise.
# 
# Default value [false].
# 
rbs.instrument.use.main.job.subdirectories=true

# True if the opening job should be run in its own subdirectory below the RB's
# product directory, false otherwise.
# 
# Default value [false].
