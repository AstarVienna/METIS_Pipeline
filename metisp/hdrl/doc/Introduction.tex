\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Motivation and Purpose}

The ESO Pipeline System Group (PPS) is developing and maintaining
a large variety of data reduction pipelines for the different
instruments. In order to decrease the implementation and maintenance
efforts of the single pipelines the \HDRL projects was launched. 

The \HDRL project aims to identify and concentrate cross-pipeline
algorithms in a single place, verify and homogenize algorithms,
implement error propagation and extensively test the different
functionality. Moreover, this should not only accelerate the
development of new pipelines, but all pipelines would instantaneously
benefit from bug-fixes and improvements in \HDRL.


The various consortia are also encouraged to propose new
functionality/algorithms for the library - the PPS and SDP department
will then evaluate the algorithm and decide if they should be part of
the \HDRL.

The pipeline developer but also the consortia are highly encouraged to
use the new library - if for some reason they want to implement
another solution to an already existing algorithm they should inform
PPS.



\subsection{Stakeholders}

The following actors may interact with the \HDRL project:
SciOps, SDP, USD, QC, PPS, Consortia

\subsection{Scope and references}

The modules implemented in the \HDRL are high-level functionalities that
are intended to be used by several VLT/VLTI instrument pipelines.

The \CPL plays exactly this role for low-level functionalities.
