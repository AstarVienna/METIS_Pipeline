        """
        The first step of writing a recipe is to define an InputSet: the one-to-one class
        that wraps all the recipe inputs. It encapsulates the entire input and

        - defines which tags to look for, optionally with placeholders like `{det}`, that can be set globally
        - which of the inputs are optional (just set `required = False`)
        - provides mechanism for verification that the required frames are actually present

        Inputs are twofold:

        - children of SinglePipelineInput, which expect exactly one frame to be present (or at most one if optional).
            They will warn is multiple frames are found and keep the last one.
        - children of MultiplePipelineInput, which expect multiple frames with the same tag (usually RAWs).
            Again, the frame set may be empty if `required` is set to False.

        You may instantiate your inputs directly as SinglePipelineInput or MultiplePipelineInput with appropriate tags,
        or use or extend one of the predefined classes (see `pymetis.inputs.common`).

        The input is automatically verified (see the base InputSet class and its Single and Multiple children)
        and an exception is raised whenever something is amiss.

        # This InputSet class derives from `DarkImageProcessor.InputSet`, which in turn inherits from
        # `RawImageProcessor.InputSet`. It already knows that it wants a RawInput and MasterDarkInput class,
        # but does not know about the tags yet. So here we define tags for the raw input:
        class RawInput(RawInput):

            #    See https://github.com/AstarVienna/METIS_DRLD/issues/321

        # Now we need a master dark. Since nothing is changed and the tag is always the same,
        # we just point to the provided MasterDarkInput. Note that we do not have to instantiate
        # it explicitly anywhere, `MasterDarkInput` takes care of that for us.

        #   - persistence comes from `PersistenceInputSetMixin`,
        #   - linearity comes from `LinearityInputSetMixin`
        #   - master dark comes from `DarkImageProcessor`
        #   - raw data come from `RawImageProcessor` via `DarkImageProcessor`
